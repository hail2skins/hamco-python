## Hamco Internet Solutions

Not really much to look at. Just my personal space to develop stuff in Python/Django currently.

This site replaced a previous Golang site with the same functionality which replaced a Rails site prior to that.

New hobbyist ideas will also start here.  

# New things this iteration:

1. Django/Python is the biggie, obviously :).
2. Using an InvitationCode model in my auth_app app to control the ability to register. Previously just poor man password protected the HTML page :).
3. Actual registration mail. Welcome mail will be sent utilizing MailJet's API.
4. Minimally impressive, but the background images in the mast rotate, not per refresh, but per page, in a randomized function, and per session, currently 2 weeks.
5. Using MailJet, customized to enable it to send password reset communications.

# Old stuff replicated
1. This is a personal blog site. So notes. I can write them, update them and delete them. You can't. Sorry.
2. Slogans returns. The slogan is just the subheading on every page you visit randomizing me being cute with every refresh.

# Stuff here now, but will go to another site

I am building a political donor walk list app where I parse through public donor information for previous statewide campaigns and allow for searches to be done based on zip code, for the most part. So new stuff for it within the app itself.

1. Pagination. I did pagination a lot with Ruby.  But first time in a while and with lots and lots of data can't avoid it.
2. Simple search conjoined with a comma to get election area donors specifically.
