## Hamco Internet Solutions

Not really much to look at. Just my personal space to develop stuff in Python/Django currently.

This site replaced a previous Golang site with the same functionality which replaced a Rails site prior to that.

New hobbyist ideas will also start here.  

# New things this iteration:

1. Django/Python is the biggie, obviously :).
2. Using an InvitationCode model in my auth_app app to control the ability to register. Previously just poor man password protected the HTML page :).
